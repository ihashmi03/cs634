This is a short list of things to pay attention to after Lecture #2. Since the 2nd lecture was on freshing up your programming skills, there are no particular recommendations but here are three key areas on Python you need to know.

1. First, Python offers basic constructs for organizing your code such as functions and classes. Make sure you know how to write functions.

2. Scikit learn APIs will be everywhere in this course. Make sure you know how to consult the API documentation when you step throigh the code. Some IDEs like Pycharm offer scientific model that allow you to get the documentation as you step through the code. 

3. All code you type should be in Python 3.

4. Numerical libraries such as numpy and scipy have their own documentation pages and they also need to be consulted as you develop your project. 

5. The best way to learn Python is to *type* code. The worst way to learn Python is to just *read* other people's code. You may choose to bring an existing code on your screen but you need to interact with it, by stepping through it in the debugger (inserting print statements is also OK) and observing how variables change as you step through the code.
